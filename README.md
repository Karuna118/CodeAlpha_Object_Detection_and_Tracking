# CodeAlpha_Object_Detection_and_Tracking
Our Object Detection and Tracking system leverages advanced computer vision techniques to identify and monitor objects in real-time. Using deep learning algorithms, the system accurately detects various objects in images or video feeds, even in complex or dynamic environments.

Once an object is detected, the tracking component follows its movement across frames, maintaining consistent identification. This enables continuous monitoring of objects, even when they move, change shape, or overlap with other objects. The system can handle multiple objects at once, distinguishing between them based on unique features such as size, shape, or motion patterns.

Designed for applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, this system offers high precision, real-time performance, and adaptability to different environments. Whether you're monitoring security cameras, detecting objects in self-driving cars, or tracking items in a warehouse, our Object Detection and Tracking solution provides robust and reliable results, enhancing efficiency and safety.
